## Faculty 

<img src="/assets/img/shawn.png" align="left" width="150px" style="margin-right: 1.5rem"/>
<strong>Shawn Chartrand</strong>: Shawn is an assistant professor at Simon Fraser University and is the lead researcher in the Landscape Dynamics Lab. He is broadly curious about how rivers and landscapes interact, from dam removal projects in California to the dynamics of ice-wedge polygons in the High Arctic. Prior to completing his PhD at the University of British Columbia, Shawn gained twenty years of experience working as a professional hydrologist and geomorphologist in Berkeley, California.

## PhD students 

<img src="/assets/img/jonas.jpg" align="left" width="150px" style="margin-right: 1.5rem"/>
<strong>Jonas Eschenfelder</strong>: Jonas is interested in how ground ice changes sediment transport dynamics to form new channel networks in permafrost regions. To explore this topic, they use flume experiments and field observations from the Canadian High Arctic.

<img src="/assets/img/Daphnee.png" align="left" width="150px" style="margin-right: 1.5rem"/>
<strong>Daphnee Tuzlak</strong>: Daphnee is a fluvial geomorphologist passionate about stewardship of river systems who links their work in river science to social change through developing interdisciplinary research teams, strengthening relationships and advocacy. 
<br>
<strong>Home unit:</strong> Resource and Environmental Management.

## MSc students 

<img src="/assets/img/grace.jpg" align="left" width="150px" style="margin-right: 1.5rem"/>
<strong>Grace Johnson</strong>: Grace uses applied physics to develop theories that explain how hillslope water streaks form and evolve in the Canadian High Arctic. Her research has implications for understanding how river basin hydrology will evolve more broadly in permafrost and periglacial environments under climate change. 
<br>
<strong>Home unit:</strong> Physics.

## Postdoctoral research fellows

<img src="/assets/img/sam.jpg" align="left" width="150px" style="margin-right: 1.5rem"/>
<strong>Sam Anderson</strong>: Sam researches the hydrological impacts of heatwaves, focusing on the streamflow response to historical extreme events and the spatial and temporal variability of heatwave-precipitation characteristics. Dr. Anderson received his PhD from the University of British Columbia working with Professor Valentina Radic in the Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences.

<img src="/assets/img/Sjoukje.JPG" align="left" width="150px" style="margin-right: 1.5rem"/>
<strong>Sjoukje de Lange</strong>: Sjoukje researches erosional mechanisms in permafrost and ice-rich environments. Dr. de Lange received her PhD from Wageningen University working with Professor Ton Hoitink and Dr. Kryss Waldschläger in the Environmental Fluid Mechanics Group.
